# Evaluation 
After allot of testing the locomotion method with my roommates, I can conclude with quite a high certainty that the locomotion method itself is not the best in reducing cyber sickness. On the other hand all my "test subjects" said even though, the method 
produces cyber sickness, the locomotion method is quite fun to play around with. It also might be worth mentioning that I introduced some Dynamic Gaussian Blur and a Dynamic FOV (after testing does not really seem to be working out of the box) from GingerVR in the end to reduce this sickness to a maximum. These are also tuned to quite high levels so that this reduction can be possible. The Gaussian Blur, reduces the feeling movement  by blurring the screen  during periods of movement and in turn making the game more realistic by that. The Documentation was found quite late into the implementation process and by that is not included in any other of the documentations of this project as well as the presentation.

The metrics that the skeleton of the project provide, were quite bad in the beginning of the participants testing my locomotion method. Both the collection of coins as well as the interaction task became better and better over time the more the participants played. In general they said that the locomotion method is quite fun, but produces allot of cyber sickens. They also mentioned that there are two ways this locomotion method can work : "Either be really quick and bad at collecting the coins or really slow and collect all the coins". For the participants being quick and collecting little to no coins gave them more fun though.

Contrary they said that the interaction method just needs some getting used to and after the can be really precise and quick. On average after playing some rounds this also showed up in their score.

# POV
For me the whole implementation process as well as getting a first contact point to VR and Unity in general was super interesting and fulfilling for me. In most other classes, the focus is more on the theoretical site and due to this "exam" being a project gave me a whole other perspective on my field of study. To some my implementation up in a sentence : "I think I archived my goal of creating a working novel locomotion and interaction technique for VR and tackled the problem of cyber sickness as good as I could."

# Future Work  

For future work it is worth mentioning that the models used for the projectiles are quite rudimentary as well as having no real good animations. You could also reduce the cyber sickness further you could also introduce, some other senses into the mix. One example for this would be the implementation of real life wind to the system to give you more perception of motion.  You might also be able to tweak the rock strength values more to make the locomotion even more satisfying and so that there is a real purpose for the parachute in the future. Another idea for a translation technique of mine was to use the pitch of the right controller in the process but was not further pursued.
