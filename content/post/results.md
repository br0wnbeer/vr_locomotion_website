# Evaluation 
After allot of testing the locomotion method with my roommates, I can conclude with quite a high certainty that. The locomotion method itself is not the best in reducing cyber sickness. On the other hand all my "test subjects" said even though, the method 
produces cyber sickness the locomotion method is quite fun to play around with. It also might be worth mentioning that I introduced some Dynamic Gaussian Blur and a Dynamic FOV (after testing does not really seem to be working out of the box) from GingerVR in the end to reduce this sickness to a maximum. These are also tuned to quite high levels so that this reduction can be possible. The Gaussian Blur, reduces the feeling movement  by blurring the screen and also making the whole game more realistic in turn. The Documentation was found quite late into the implementation process and by that is not included in any other of the documentations as well as the presentation.

For the results for the metrics recorded in from the parkour itself all seem to be related to how much the participant had already played the game before. Both the collecting of coins became better and better as well as the metric for the interaction task. 

In general you might say this locomotion method is very fun but produces allot of cyber sickness. Contrary to the interaction that produces no cyber sickness at all but takes allot of getting used to. 
For me the whole implementation process as well as getting a first contact point to VR and Unity in general was super interesting and fulfilling for me. In most other classes, the focus is more on the theoretical site and due to this being a project gave me a whole other perspective on my field of study. 

# Future Work  

The models used for the projectiles are quite rudimentary as well as having not real good animations. To reduce the cyber sickness further you could also introduce, some other senses into the mix. One example for this would be the implementation of real life wind to the system to give you more perception of motion.  You might also be able to tweak the rock strength values more to make the locomotion even more satisfying and so that there is a real purpose for the parachute. Another idea a translation technique of mine was to use the pitch of the right controller in the process but was not further pursued.
